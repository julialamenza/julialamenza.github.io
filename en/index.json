But what does this have to do with career? For a long time, I made the mistake of comparing myself to others. I work in a field full of people who inspire me and are extremely qualified, which often made me feel like I wasn’t good enough or that I was falling behind in my learning. I used to think that while everyone had already mastered a certain technology, I was still struggling to learn another one. That kind of comparison never brought me anything positive. On the contrary, it was through engaging more in communities and events that I realized a fundamental truth: everyone has their own time and journey. We shouldn’t compare ourselves to others, but to ourselves. It might sound like a cliché, but it’s a powerful truth. Each person follows a unique path, with their own skills and challenges. What works for one person may not work for you, and that’s okay. The most important thing is to respect your own journey and understand that even those you admire face challenges similar to yours. There’s nothing wrong with not knowing what the next step will be or with being curious about everything. The mistake is in trying to keep up with others, forgetting that you are unique. Respect your learning process, refine your methods, but never feel less worthy just because someone progressed faster in a certain area. That doesn’t diminish your value; it only means you might find ease in other areas. There will always be days when you feel insecure or lost, and others when everything makes sense. It’s normal to miss out on events or courses, just as it’s normal to have moments of higher engagement. And that’s okay too. Learning is a journey, and you must respect both that process and your mental health. Trying to take on everything at once is not always the best approach.

I dive into the world of SRE and DevOps with a smile, always ready to match the latest tech with business needs in the most chill way possible. My playground? A mix of networking, security, and monitoring across all sorts of digital landscapes—containers, VMs, you name it. I’ve been the go-to person for making sure our digital spaces are not just up and running, but also snug and secure. On the tech side, I’ve got a suitcase packed with Linux and Windows know-how, ready for any adventure. From setting up systems to tweaking configurations for that perfect performance, I’m all about keeping our IT infrastructure ready for anything. And when I’m not in the tech trenches? I’m out traveling, meeting new people, and collecting stories. Because, hey, life’s too short not to enjoy the journey, both online and off.
