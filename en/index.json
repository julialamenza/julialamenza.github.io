[{"categories":null,"content":"Cloud Engineer by day, explorer by heart. I dive into the world of SRE and DevOps with a smile, always ready to match the latest tech with business needs in the most chill way possible. My playground?

I’ve been the go-to person for making sure our digital spaces are not just up and running, but also snug and secure. On the tech side, I’ve got a suitcase packed with Linux and Windows know-how, ready for any adventure. From setting up systems to tweaking configurations for that perfect performance, I’m all about keeping our IT infrastructure ready for anything. And when I’m not in the tech trenches? I’m out traveling, meeting new people, and collecting stories. Because, hey, life’s too short not to enjoy the journey, both online and off.
